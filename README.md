# üõí Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## üìñ About the Project

This project explores Walmart sales data to understand top-performing branches and products, analyze sales trends, and examine customer behavior. The ultimate goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help improve and optimize sales strategies.

The dataset is sourced from the **Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition**.

> "In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 3 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact."_ ‚Äî _Kaggle_

## üéØ Project Purpose

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analytical Approach

### 1. Data Wrangling
- Inspection and handling of missing or NULL values.
- Table creation with `NOT NULL` constraints to avoid null entries.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- `time_of_day`: Categorize transactions into Morning, Afternoon, Evening.
- `day_name`: Extract weekday (Mon‚ÄìSun) from date.
- `month_name`: Extract month (Jan‚ÄìDec) from date.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed using SQL and visualization tools to address all business questions.
- Metrics and trends identified to uncover actionable insights.
