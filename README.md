# üõí Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## üìñ About the Project

This project explores Walmart sales data to understand top-performing branches and products, analyze sales trends, and examine customer behavior. The ultimate goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help improve and optimize sales strategies.

The dataset is sourced from the **Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition**.

> "In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 3 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact."_ ‚Äî _Kaggle_

## üéØ Project Purpose

The main objective is to gain insights into the sales performance across different Walmart branches and product lines, and to understand the customer and sales patterns that influence these performances.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analytical Approach

### 1. Data Wrangling
- Inspection and handling of missing or NULL values.
- Table creation with `NOT NULL` constraints to avoid null entries.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- `time_of_day`: Categorize transactions into Morning, Afternoon, Evening.
- `day_name`: Extract weekday (Mon‚ÄìSun) from date.
- `month_name`: Extract month (Jan‚ÄìDec) from date.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed using SQL and visualization tools to address all business questions.
- Metrics and trends identified to uncover actionable insights.

# Revenue and Profit Calculations step-by-step in a simple and clear way

What the terms mean:
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):
This is how much it costs to buy or produce the products you sold.
Formula: 
       COGS= unitPrice √ó quantity

VAT (Value Added Tax):
This is a tax charged on the sale, set at 5% of the COGS.
Formula:
VAT = 5% √ó COGS

Total (Gross Sales):
This is what you bill the customer, which is the sum of the COGS plus the VAT.
Formula:  total¬†(gross¬†sales)= COGS + VAT

Gross Profit (Gross Income):
This is the profit you make before deducting other expenses, and it's the VAT amount in this case (because COGS is your cost, and you add VAT on top).
Formula: gross Profit =total¬†(gross¬†sales) ‚àí COGS =VAT

Gross Margin:
This shows how much profit you make as a percentage of your total revenue (gross sales).
Formula:  Gross¬†Margin=    total¬†revenue / grossProfit  √ó 100%
                          
Example calculation (with your first row data):
Unit Price = 45.79
Quantity = 7
‚Äã
Step 1: Calculate COGS  = COGS= 45.79 √ó 7= 320.53

Step 2: Calculate VAT = VAT=5%√ó320.53=16.0265

Step 3: Calculate Total (Gross Sales) = 
       total= COGS + VAT = 320.53 + 16.0265 = 336.5565

Profit = Selling Price (before VAT) ‚Äì Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Example:
Let‚Äôs assume:

COGS = $45.79 √ó 7 = $320.53

You add 20% profit margin to COGS:
Selling¬†Price¬†(before¬†VAT)=320.53+(20%√ó320.53) = 320.53+64.106 =384.636
VAT (5%) is added on top of that: 

VAT = 5% √ó 384.636 = 19.2318
otal price customer pays = 384.636 + 19.2318 = $403.87

Final Summary:
You collected $403.87 from the customer

You send $19.23 to the government as VAT

Your own profit = $384.64 (your selling price) ‚Äì $320.53 (your cost) = $64.11

‚úÖ Your real profit: $64.11
